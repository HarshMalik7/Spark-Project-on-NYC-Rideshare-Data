Calculate the driver's earnings (driver_total_pay field) for each business in each month. Draw the histogram with 'business-month' on the x-axis and the driver's earnings on the y-axis. For example, assume if the driver's earnings for Uber in January is 4444444, 'Uber-1' will be on the x-axis, indicating 4444444 above the bar of 'Uber-1'.
