Task 2: Aggregation of Data
1. Count the number of trips for each business in each month. Draw the histogram with 'business-month' on the x-axis and trip counts on the y-axis. For example, assume if the number of trips for Uber in January (i.e. 'Uber-1') is 222222222, 'Uber-1' will be on the x-axis, indicating 222222222 above the bar of 'Uber-1'.
2. Calculate the platform's profits (rideshare_profit field) for each business in each month. Draw the histogram with 'business-month' on the x-axis and the platform's profits on the y-axis. For example, assume if the platform's profits for Uber in January is 33333333, 'Uber-1' will be on the x-axis, indicating 33333333 above the bar of 'Uber-1'.
3. Calculate the driver's earnings (driver_total_pay field) for each business in each month. Draw the histogram with 'business-month' on the x-axis and the driver's earnings on the y-axis. For example, assume if the driver's earnings for Uber in January is 4444444, 'Uber-1' will be on the x-axis, indicating 4444444 above the bar of 'Uber-1'.
4. When we are analyzing data, it's not just about getting results, but also about extracting insights to make decisions or understand the market. Suppose you were one of the stakeholders, for example, the driver, CEO of the business, stockbroker, etc, What do you find from the three results? How do the findings help you make strategies or make decisions?

Note, that the above figures/values do not represent the actual result.
