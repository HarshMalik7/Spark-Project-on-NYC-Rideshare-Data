Calculate the platform's profits (rideshare_profit field) for each business in each month. Draw the histogram with 'business-month' on the x-axis and the platform's profits on the y-axis. For example, assume if the platform's profits for Uber in January is 33333333, 'Uber-1' will be on the x-axis, indicating 33333333 above the bar of 'Uber-1'.
